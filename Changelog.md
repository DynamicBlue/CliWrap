### v2.5 (30-Oct-2019)

- Added callbacks that trigger when stdout/stderr streams are closed. (Thanks @Daniel15)
- Added an overload for `SetCancellationToken` that accepts `killEntireProcessTree`. Passing `true` to this option will make CliShellWrap attempt to kill the entire process tree when cancellation is requested, as opposed to only the parent process. Note, this option is only available on .NET Framework 4.5+ and .NET Core 3.0+. (Thanks @M-Patrone)
- Removed ReSharpe annotations.

### v2.4 (03-Oct-2019)

- Added `ProcessId` property to `Cli`. You can use it to get the ID of the underlying process as soon as it's started.

### v2.3.1 (10-Jul-2019)

- Fixed an issue where `Execute` and `ExecuteAsync` didn't return immediately after the execution was canceled.
- Fixed an issue where setting the same environment variable twice resulted in an error.
- Improved exception message in `ExitCodeValidationException` and `StandardErrorValidationException`.

### v2.3 (29-May-2019)

- Added an overload for `SetArguments` that takes a list. You can pass multiple arguments and they will be automatically encoded to preserve whitespace and other special characters.
- Fixed some typos in documentation.

### v2.2.2 (10-May-2019)

- Fixed an issue where `ExecuteAndForget` was throwing an exception if the underlying process outlived the execution of the method.

### v2.2.1 (01-Apr-2019)

- `ExitCodeValidationException` and `StandardErrorValidationException` now display both exit code and standard error inside the message. Useful when a process reported a non-zero exit code but the actual error message is in stderr.
- Removed `netcoreapp1.0` target.

### v2.2 (20-Dec-2018)

- Added `Cli.Wrap` static method to replace `new Cli()` for a more fluent interface. This also makes it so you're dealing with `ICli` instead of `Cli` throughout the entire method chain.
- Standard error validation is now disabled by default. This change was made because quite a few CLIs (e.g. git, ffmpeg) write progress to stderr.
- Changed `Execute` and `ExecuteAsync` to complete only after the process exits, regardless of cancellation. This fixes a problem where the underlying process could live for some brief moments after those methods returned, in case of cancellation.
- If `Execute` or `ExecuteAsync` is canceled, the underlying process will now be killed without waiting for standard input to write completely.
- Reworked underlying process handling to improve performance and maintainability. The `Execute` and `ExecuteAsync` methods are now virtually the same in terms of code, unlike before, where they were considerably different.

### v2.1 (15-Oct-2018)

- Added `ExecutionResult` to `ExitCodeValidationException` and `StandardErrorValidationException`. This way additional information can be inspected during debugging.
- `ExitCodeValidationException` and `StandardErrorValidationException` are now derived from `ExecutionResultValidationException`.
- Improved cancellation handling in synchronous workflow.
- Cancellation token is now used when writing stdin in asynchronous workflow.

### v2.0.1 (17-Sep-2018)

- Methods that used to return an instance of `Cli` now return `ICli` where applicable.

### v2.0 (12-Sep-2018)

- Re-designed the API so that it follows the builder pattern. Execution parameters are now supplied using chainable methods on the `Cli` instead of via `ExecutionInput`. Things like `BufferHandler` and `CancellationToken` are now also configured in the same manner. *Refer to the readme to see updated usage examples.*
- It is now also possible to pipe a raw stream to standard input, instead of just a text string.
- Removed `ExecutionInput`, `CliSettings`, `BufferHandler`, `EncodingSettings`.
- Renamed `ExecutionOutput` to `ExecutionResult`.
- Removed `ExecutionResult.HasError` and `ExecutionResult.ThrowIfError()`.
- Added an option to automatically throw an exception when the underlying process reports a non-zero exit code. Is enabled by default.
- Added an option to automatically throw an exception when the underlying process writes anything to standard error. Is enabled by default.

### v1.8.5 (09-Jun-2018)

- Fixed exception messages not appearing in Visual Studio's exception popup.

### v1.8.4 (09-Mar-2018)

- `StandardErrorException` now shows the value of `StandardError` in `Message`.

### v1.8.3 (03-Mar-2018)

- Added `ICli` to aid in testing.

### v1.8.2 (02-Feb-2018)

- Made input model classes more accessible by removing immutability.
- `Cli` now throws exception if used after getting disposed.

### v1.8.1 (25-Jan-2018)

- Fixed another process leak when canceling synchronous `Execute`.

### v1.8 (25-Jan-2018)

- Refactored additional `Cli` constructor parameters into a separate class called `CliSettings`. This is breaking if you used to supply more than 1 parameter to the constructor.
- `Execute` and `ExecuteAsync` no longer depend on process getting successfully killed. An attempt to kill it is made but if it's not successful, no exception is thrown.
- All `CancellationToken` callbacks are now exception-safe.
- Fixed an issue where `CancellationToken` would throw an out of scope exception when the process could not be killed.
- Fixed a race condition when an execution task is completed and canceled at the same time.

### v1.7.5 (21-Jan-2018)

- Added `EncodingSettings` to customize stream encoding.
- Added some ReSharper annotations to improve warnings and suggestions.

### v1.7.4 (10-Jan-2018)

- Execution start and exit times are now calculated separately, without accessing `Process` instance.
- Execution start and exit times are now `DateTimeOffset` instead of `DateTime`.
- Fixed an issue that prevented CliShellWrap from properly working on Linux.
